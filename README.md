# Apple Quality Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze and predict apple quality based on various physical and chemical characteristics like size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity. By applying machine learning, the goal is to classify apples into quality categories such as "good" or "bad" to assist in sorting and quality assurance processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes the following columns:
- **A_id**: Unique identifier for each apple sample.
- **Size**: Size measurement of the apple.
- **Weight**: Weight of the apple.
- **Sweetness**: Sweetness level.
- **Crunchiness**: Crunchiness level.
- **Juiciness**: Juiciness level.
- **Ripeness**: Ripeness score.
- **Acidity**: Acidity level.
- **Quality**: Target variable (good/bad).

## Project Structure

The project workflow is divided into the following main steps:

1. **Data Importing and Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and standardizing feature scales.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of apple quality characteristics.
   - Analyzing relationships between features to identify key indicators of apple quality.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features that could enhance model performance.
   - Applying feature scaling and transformations if necessary.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Training various machine learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression.
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Tuning model hyperparameters to optimize results.
